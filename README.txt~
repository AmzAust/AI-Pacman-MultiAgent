For my implementation of this project I frequently used a number of things
to help with various calculations needed for obtaining distances. One of
the main items used was the manhattan distance. I used it throughout
the code to figure out distances from ghosts or food and used max or
min functions to take various actions. In order for pacman to take certain
actions I placed penalties for him doing something like subtracting
points for stopping or leaving food uneaten or leaving capsules uneaten.
These kinds of things helped for when pacman would spend time idling or
if he would begin running from ghosts when they are too far away for it
to even matter. For greater accuracy in these calculations, floating point 
values were frequently used. I spent roughly 25 hours working on this project.
